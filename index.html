        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.</li>
                <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
                <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
                <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.</li>
            </ul>
